## 📚 Course Modules

We have structured the content into three logical pillars, taking you from data structures (matrices) to the study of change (calculus).

### 1. Algebra: The Structure
Focuses on **Linear Algebra**, the foundation of modern computing and data science.

* **Matrices:** Definitions, operations, and special types.
* **Determinants:** Sarrus, Laplace, and geometric interpretation.
* **Inverse Matrices:** Cofactors and Gauss-Jordan elimination.
* **Systems of Equations:** Solving $Ax=b$ using Cramer's Rule, Inverses, and Gaussian Elimination.

### 2. Geometry: The Space
Focuses on **Vector Analysis** and **Analytic Geometry** in 3D space.
* **Vectors:** Operations, magnitude, and unit vectors.
* **Vector Products:** Dot product (angles), Cross product (normals), and Triple product (volumes).
* **Analytic Geometry:** Defining Lines and Planes in 3D space and analyzing their intersections.

### 3. Calculus: The Engine
The study of continuous change, motion, and accumulation.
* **Functions & Limits:** The rigorous foundation of analysis.
* **Derivatives:** Instantaneous rates of change and optimization.
* **Integrals:** Area, volume, and accumulation (Riemann & Newton-Leibniz).
* **Differential Equations:** Modeling real-world phenomena (growth, decay, motion).

## 🐍 Python & Calculator

This project isn't just about formulas; it's about application. Throughout the notes, you will find:
* **Python Implementations:** How to solve math problems using `NumPy`.
* **The Calculator:** A custom Python script included in this repo to perform matrix operations, vector calculations, and more directly from your terminal.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Select a module from the **navigation menu** on the left (or top) to begin your journey.

* **Built with:** [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) & [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
