# Algebra Formulas

Here is a collection of 10 fundamental formulas used frequently in Algebra.

## 1. Quadratic Formula
Used to find the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## 2. Slope-Intercept Form
The equation of a line with slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$.

$$
y = mx + b
$$

## 3. Difference of Squares
A method for factoring binomials.

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
$$

## 4. Perfect Square Trinomial
Expansion of a squared binomial.

$$
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

## 5. Distance Formula
Calculates the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

## 6. Midpoint Formula
Finds the center point between two coordinates.

$$
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

## 7. Logarithm Product Rule
Simplifies the logarithm of a product.

$$
\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)
$$

## 8. Logarithm Power Rule
Moves the exponent to the front of the logarithm.

$$
\log_b(x^n) = n \cdot \log_b(x)
$$

## 9. Arithmetic Sequence Term
Finds the $n$-th term where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the difference.

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
$$

## 10. Geometric Sequence Term
Finds the $n$-th term where $r$ is the common ratio.

$$
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
$$
