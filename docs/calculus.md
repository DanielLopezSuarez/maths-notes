# Calculus Formulas

Key formulas for differentiation and integration.

## 1. Definition of Derivative
The fundamental limit definition of a derivative.

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

## 2. Power Rule
The basic rule for differentiating powers of $x$.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n \cdot x^{n-1}
$$

## 3. Product Rule
Used when differentiating two functions multiplied together.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$

## 4. Quotient Rule
Used when differentiating one function divided by another.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$

## 5. Chain Rule
Used for differentiating composite functions.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

## 6. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Relates differentiation and integration.

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

## 7. Integration by Parts
The product rule in reverse for integration.

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

## 8. L'Hôpital's Rule
Used to evaluate limits that result in indeterminate forms like $0/0$.

$$
\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

## 9. Maclaurin Series for $e^x$
Expansion of the exponential function.

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots
$$

## 10. Mean Value Theorem
States there is a tangent parallel to the secant line.

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$
